***About:***
For this project I wanted to explore one of my passions which is real estate. I was able to locate a dataset on Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data that contained data about homes in Ames, Iowa. This dataset contained two files a training dataset and a test dataset. The test dataset had a missing class so for this assignment I strictly used the training dataset and split this up accordingly. In this data there are 81 attributes. They include items such as square footage, bathrooms, bedrooms, condition, etc. These attributes are all details about the property. 

***Goal:***
The goal of this project is to use this dataset to determine if a house is “expensive” or “affordable”. Expensive is defined as anything over the mean sale price, while affordable is anything equal to or below the mean sale price.

***How to Run:***
I broke my code into four files: final project_naive_bayes.py, final project random forest.py, final project knn.py, and final project kmeans.py. Each runs the classifier that is in the name. I also included a report, and a csv file of the data.
